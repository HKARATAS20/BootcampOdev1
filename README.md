Total price of regular houses: 1800000

Total price of villas: 4000000

Total price of summer houses: 2830000

Total price of all houses: 8630000



Average sqm of regular houses: 130.0
Average sqm of villas: 210.0

Average sqm of summer houses: 181.66666666666666

Average sqm of all houses: 173.88888888888889
